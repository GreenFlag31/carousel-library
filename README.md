# Installation

| Version | Command                       | Description                                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| V17     | npm i ngx-carousel-ease@0.1.4 | Install the V17 compatible version.                                                                 |
| V18     | npm i ngx-carousel-ease@0.1.6 | Install the V18 compatible version. This version is compatible with a zoneless Angular application. |
| V19     | npm i ngx-carousel-ease       | Install the V19 compatible version. This version is RxJS-free.                                      |

Then, add the `CarouselComponent` in the imports array of the hosting component (if standalone) or to your `appModule`.
Finally, add your cards content within the `<carousel></carousel>` selector in the hosting component. Each of your card should contain the class `carousel-slide`.

```html
<carousel>
  <div class="carousel-slide">...</div>
  <div class="carousel-slide">...</div>
  ...
</carousel>
```

# Inputs

The carousel is configured by default and all inputs are optional.

# Service

This library provides a CarouselService containing an RxJs BehaviorSubject `onSlideChange` that is triggered at every slide change. `onSlideChange` returns an object containing the current slide number and the carousel ID (useful if multiple carousel on a page to target a specific carousel instance). The slide number and carousel ID are zero indexed.

Inject the CarouselService through regular dependency injection in your hosting component.

_From the V19, RxJs has been replaced by a Javascript CustomEvent._

```javascript
// V16 => V18
ngOnInit() {
  this.carouselService.onSlideChange.subscribe((slideAndID) => {
    // change carousel colors, trigger a function, ...
  });
}

// From V19: target your carousel element, and listen for a `slideChange` event.
thirdCarousel.addEventListener('slideChange', (data: CustomEventInit) => {
  const slide = data.detail; // the slide number

  // change carousel colors, trigger a function, ...
});

```

The third example in the demo uses this functionnality.

# Style Customisation

Given the nearly infinite and subjective possibilities for customization, a predefined choice of themes (such as light or dark) has not been incorporated.

If you wish to customize the theme or parts of the carousel, add `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None` to the hosting parent component and erase the default styles. Find the corresponding classes by inspecting the DOM.

The following example changes the defaulted blue arrows:

```css
.carousel-container .prev,
.carousel-container .next {
  background: red !important;
}
```

# SSR (Server Side Rendering)

This library supports Server Side Rendering (SSR). The carousel will not instantiate during server-side execution, as it requires access to the DOM API, preventing errors.

# DX Friendly

Ensuring a seamless Developer Experience (DX), basic validation is performed on the parameters passed to the carousel. An error is raised in case of abnormal parameters. Please note that common sense mistakes, such as passing a negative value for slide to show or a negative carousel max width, are not validated. This library has been meticulously documented.

# Performance

Emphasis has been placed on performance, adopting `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` and utilizing `translate3d` instead of `translateX`. This choice aims to enable hardware acceleration in specific scenarios, which can contribute to a smoother and more efficient user experience. By default, if infinite mode is enabled, a function will prevent infinite DOM growth by removing invisible cards.

# Change log

Version 0.0.7: Support for dynamically HTML generated content (ngFor, @for) for slide creation. Correction of a validation bug.

Version 0.0.9: Change in the behavior of the auto slide. Auto slide will now occur on drag stop (when the user releases the mouse), and will automatically slide towards the nearest slide based on the set threshold. Auto slide is set to true by default.

Version 0.1.1: Fixed a race condition that could occur betweeen evaluation of the template and initialisation of the variables.

Version 0.1.2: Adding an autoPlay feature.

Version 0.1.6: Blocking resize event triggered at vertical scrolling on phones.

Version 0.1.7: Removing RxJs to anticipate the future optional RxJs. Transforming inputs to signals.

Version 0.1.8: TouchEvent fix for Firefox. Thanks to @seba174.

Version 0.1.9: Internal API refactoring, signal based template, and bug fix.

# Report a Bug
